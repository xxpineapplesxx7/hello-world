    <p class="p1"><b>❃ Introduction ❃</b></p>
    <p class="p5">
        ▪︎My name is Mia Alvarez, and I am a computer science major. I'm 18 and a sophmore 
        at Lewis University and currently live on campus. 
        I grew up in Bolingbrook and played softball growing up.
        I spend a lot of time with my family and I have three 
        younger brothers and one dog and two turtles. 
        A few things I enjoy doing are traveling, photography, dancing 
        and video games. I'm currently working as an brand abassador for 
        HBO max and doing work on social media and streaming on twitch.

        <h2>-Fav Hobby-</h2>
        <p>▪︎My favorite activity is traveling. I love seeing new people and traveling the world. 
            Experiencing  different cultures and customs really intrigues me.
             My favorite places I have been too has been Mexico. Seeing where my family 
            grew up and getting to try new food and see places is very fun. 
            I learned a lot of spanish in order to talk to family and understand 
            more in Mexico.
            You can learn a lot about different people and cultures. 
            My dream place to vist is Toyko Japan. </p>

        <h2>-Fun Fact-</h2>
        <p>▪︎Over the summer I got into twitch streaming. 
            Lucky I was able to become a twitch affiliate
            and make money doing something I love. 
            I mainly streamed video game content with friends. 
            I was able to  build a following and create my own discord server with my viewers.
             Being able to have fun and being passionate about making content was a cool experience. </p>
