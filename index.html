    <p class="p1"><b>♡ Introduction ♡</b></p>
    <p class="p5">
        My name is Mia Alvarez, and I am a computer scienece major. I'm 18 and a sophmore 
        at Lewis University and currently live on campus. 
        I grew up in Bolingbrook and played softball growing up.
        I spend a lot of time with my family and I have three 
        younger brothers and one dog and two turtles. 
        A few things I enjoy doing are traveling, photography, dancing 
        and video games. I'm currently working as an brand abassador for 
        HBO max and doing work on social media and streaming on twitch.

    <p class="p3"><b>♡ My favorite hobby ♡</b></p>
    <p>
        My favorite activity is traveling. I love seeing new people and traveling the world. 
        Experiencing  different cultures and customs really intrigues me.
         My favorite places I have been too has been Mexico. Seeing where my family 
        grew up and getting to try new food and see places is very fun. 
        I learned a lot of spanish in order to talk to family and understand 
        more in Mexico. You can learn a lot about different people and cultures. 
        My dream place to vist is Toyko Japan.

    <p>Over the summer I got into twitch streaming. 
        Lucky I was able to become a twitch affiliate
        and make money doing something I love. 
        I mainly streamed video game content with friends. 
        I was able to  build a following and create my own discord server with my viewers.
         Being able to have fun and being passionate about making content was a cool experience.
